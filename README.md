# CHECKERS Game with P5.js

Recently, I started learning some AI. I learnt about games and adversarial search and decided to put what I have learnt to practice to get a better understanding of all the concepts. Initially, I built a simple console text-based TIC-TAC-TOE AI which was a success. I decided to do something more complex and that's what gave birth to this project.
